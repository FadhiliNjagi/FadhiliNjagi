- 👋 Hi, I’m @FadhiliNjagi
- 👀 I’m interested in full-stack cross-platform web and app Development, and building AI models.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning .NET Blazor, Nuxt JS and using Hugging Face AI models.
- ⚒  Skills:
  - Programming: Javascript, TypeScript, C#, Python, PHP, C++.
  - Frontend (HTML, CSS, Js, Vue Js, Quasar, Nuxt JS, .NET Blazor, .NET MAUI)
  - Backend (Node + Fastify/Adonis JS, ASP.NET, Laravel)
  - AI: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, Tensorflow, Transformers.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on web projects
- 📝 I use [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/fadhili_njagi) for most of my personal projects. It was my first love.
- My Github and Gitlab profiles are not very active since I have a full-time developer job, and I am also working on private projects, including [Stakimu](https://stakimu.com).
- 📫 Contact me at fadhili.njagi@stakimu.com
